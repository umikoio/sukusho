  <h1>Sukusho</h1>
  <p>The native screenshot history manager for MacOS</p>
</div>

Sukusho is a utility that saves your screenshot history in memory, so if you need to take multiple screenshots, but don't want to save them immediately to your local drive, this is for you. After you successfully take a screenshot, a row will populate in Sukusho's top menu bar. These screenshots will remain until you clear the history, exceed the max number of screenshots (10), or quit the program.

You may also notice there isn' a dock icon. You'll find Sukusho in the top menu bar. You can manage your screenshots there. Sukusho was created to be very simple and not cause any obstructions to daily operations.

> [!IMPORTANT] While Sukusho is safe to use, works fully offline, and has no collected analytics whatsoever built-in, I've decided to not sign the app. This does require a minor small step on your part. You'll find instructions below.

NOTE: Sekusho is not currently compatible with the default MacOS screenshot utility or screenshot shortcuts. You must use Sekusho directly to take and save screenshots. I have these on the backlog.

#### Windows / Linux Support?
I built this for MacOS only using native interfaces (i.e Swift, AppKit, etc.), however, if I ever personally need something like this on Linux or Windows, I'll build it. If this project gains traction and people need a solution for Linux or Windows, I'll build it. If you seriously need something like this, create an issue for your operating system, and I'll begin looking into it.
